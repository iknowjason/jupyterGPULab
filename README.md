* **Run only when needed.** Use terraform destroy to tear down all resources when you are finished.

* **Stop the Notebook Instance.** You can stop the SageMaker Notebook instance from the AWS Console to avoid charges for it while keeping the model endpoint running.

* **Monitor your billing dashboard.** Use the AWS Cost Explorer to track your spending in near-real-time.
